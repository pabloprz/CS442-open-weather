# CS442: Open Weather

Project for CS442 course (Mobile Application Development) at Illinois Institute of Technology for my Master's in Computer Science.

This app displays a variety of weather data for a specified location provided by the user â€“ current weather, hourly forecast (48 hours), and daily forecast (7 days).

Units can be toggled between imperial and metric.

Weather data is received from OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/)
